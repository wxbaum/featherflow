# Featherflow

Welcome to Featherflow! 

This is a lightweight task-scheduling tool designed for use with Docker. Multiple tasks with dependencies on one another can be chained together to create DAGs. If you're familiar with AirFlow, this tool is much the same concept, just in a significantly more lightweight package. 

If you're not familiar with DAGs, Astronomer has a good [introduction]([https://airflow.apache.org/](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/what-exactly-is-a-dag/#:~:text=A%20DAG%20is%20a%20Directed,represent%20an%20almost%20identical%20mechanism). 

If you're looking for a highly scalable solution with rich features, [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is a better option. If you only need a basic tool, or one without the same RAM and CPU overhead, keep reading.
